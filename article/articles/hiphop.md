# Pink Floyd - The Wall
## Claudio Satriano
### From [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall)

The Wall is the eleventh studio album by English rock band Pink Floyd, released
in 1979 through Harvest and Columbia Records. Conceived during the In The Flesh
tour, recording spanned nearly a year, from December 1978 to November 1979, and
took place in France, England, New York, and Los Angeles. It was produced by Bob
Erzin, who helped to refine the concept and bridge tensions during recording.
Some of the outtakes from the recording sessions were used on the band's next
album, The Final Cut (1983).

A rock opera and a concept record, its story explores Pink, a jaded rockstar
that bassist Roger Waters modeled after himself and band founder Syd Barrett.
Pink's life begins with the loss of his father during the Second World War and
continues with abuse from his schoolteachers, an overprotective mother, and the
breakdown of his marriage; all contribute to his eventual self-imposed isolation
from society, symbolised by a wall. The band, who were then struggling with
personal and financial difficulties, supported the idea. The Wall is the last
album to feature Pink Floyd as a quartet; keyboardist Richard Wright was fired
by Waters during production, but stayed on as a salaried musician. The record
was promoted with three singles: "Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2", "Run Like
Hell", and "Comfortably Numb", the first of which became the band's only number
one single in the US. From 1980 to 1981, the group embarked on The Wall Tour,
which was notable for its elaborate theatrical effects. The concept was later
adapted into a feature film of the same name, directed by Alan Parker and
released in 1982.

The Wall received mixed reviews from critics upon its release, many of whom
found its contents to be overblown and pretentious. Retrospectively, it is
considered one of the greatest albums of all time, and is one of the most
well-known concept albums. The record was a commercial success, reaching number
one in the US (where it stayed for 15 weeks), and number three in the UK. As of
2018, the album has sold over 24 million copies, the second best-selling in the
band's catalog, as well as one of the best-selling of all time.

### The greatest hip hop album of the 21st century.

Imagine the **hip hop** of today without the influence of OutKast’s fourth album. No Stankonia: quite possibly no Frank Ocean, no Janelle Monáe, 
no Shabazz Palaces; no southern playas taking the four elements from New York to outer space via the suburbs of the ATL. How boring.

While Stankonia wasn’t the first taste of this dynamic duo’s inspired interpretations of rap – schizophrenic pieces that tapped funk up for 
its number before forgetting to call it back; snapping trap-rap rockers unleashed before the world caught up with the parlance – it was the 
most perfect distillation of everything that’d come before it. Immediate long-play predecessor, 1998’s Aquemini, was a plaudit-magnet in its
own right; a platinum-seller which piqued significant domestic interest yet didn’t translate to a global audience. But with the new millennium
came new opportunities for partners-in-rhyme André 3000 and Big Boi: Stankonia is the sound of every cracked-open door being kicked off its hinges.

Before Stankonia came **B.O.B** – an unusual lead-single selection given its ménage-a-trois of jitterbug drum’n’bass, gospel backing vocals and a
virtuosic instrumental sensibility owing much to Sly Stone and Hendrix. The single was no commercial high-flyer, but set a tone that its parent
LP would adroitly adhere to: anything goes, so long as it flows. And flow Stankonia had to, brilliantly, because for the second consecutive set
its makers pushed CD capacity, filling a 74-minute run-time.

Amongst its 24 tracks are skippable skits, although these add contextual colour to the album’s singular bravado, but for the most part Stankonia
serves the album format, rather than the other way around. Its sequencing, its pacing, these are perfect; transitions from casual vocabulary to
lightning verses, electrifying. Time has painted some cuts as relative filler: the booty-clap bounce of We Luv Deez Hoez and fizzy meditation on
carnal etiquette I’ll Call Before I Come are shallower of emotional depth than the still-exquisite Ms Jackson and the (Sign “O” the Times-period)
Prince-recalling Toilet Tisha. It was Ms Jackson that cracked the UK for these ATLiens, charting at two.

That remains their highest position to date, one better than the evergreen Hey Ya! achieved. With no OutKast LP since 2006’s Idlewild, it’s unclear
if they’ll ever match its chart impact. But if Stankonia forever remains this outfit’s ultimate record, it’s some achievement to call the greatest
hip hop album of the 21st century one of your own.
